# Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
This project implements femtoRV32, a simplified RISC-V RV32I processor for FPGA deployment on the Nexys A7 platform. The processor supports the RV32I base integer instruction set, incorporates pipelining with hazard management, and is tested both through simulation and directly on FPGA hardware.
